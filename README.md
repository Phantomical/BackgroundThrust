# Background Thrust

This is a mod for KSP that allows you to perform burns during timewarp or, if
certain dependencies are available, completely in the background.

## Features
* Make burns while in time warp!
* Make burns while the ship is out of focus! (With the right dependencies)
* The vessel automatically tracks your SAS mode.
* Automatic management of resource buffers so that your ion engines keep working
  at high warp factors.

download and must be installed separately.
